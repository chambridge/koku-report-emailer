### Obtain source for local projects
To get started developing the koku-report-emailer first clone a local copy of the git repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/project-koku/koku-report-emailer.git
```

### Configure environment variables
Many configuration settings can be read in from a `.env` file. An example file `.env.dev.example` is provided in the repository. To use the defaults simply run:
```
cp .env.dev.example .env
```

Modify as you see fit.

### Using pipenv
A Pipfile is provided. Pipenv is recommended for combining virtual environment (virtualenv) and dependency management (pip). To install pipenv, use pip :

```
pip3 install pipenv
```

Then project dependencies and a virtual environment can be created using:
```
pipenv install --dev
```

Install the pre-commit hooks for the repository:
```
